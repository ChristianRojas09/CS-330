## How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first conceptualizing the application. I conceptualize by considering the applications use, how the user will interact with it, and what it should look like.

# How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development by building one part of the system at a time. In this case, I started with the table(plane) in a blank space and built around that. On top of the plane is where I would place objects, and around those objects I introduced a moveable camera, lighting, and object textures.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Through CS, I have been able to learn a wide range of tools to help me as a developer. From C++, to graphics APIs like OpenGL. These tools have helped me become a better developer, but also shown me many different applications for software. Through time, I hope to use what I have learned to decide which path I want to take as a developer.
